This program generates physical variable (i.e. density, velocity pressure, sound
speed) solution data at a specified point in space and time for the converging
shock wave problem first solved by G. Guderley.

It follows the notation given in [Lazarus1981]_

'guderley_1D' makes use of several subprograms and functions in order to
calculate the two nonlinear eigenvalues that appear in the problem: the
similarity exponent 'lambda' and the reflected shock position (in similarity
variables) 'B.' Once these values are calculated the self-similar equations
governing the flow are solved for the dimensionless velocity V, sound speed C,
and density R, as a function of the similarity variable:

.. math::
  x = \frac{t}{r^\lambda}

The program  also computes the result starting from x = infinity (Lazarus,
p. 330 ff.). The subroutine that transforms the similarity variable data is
self-contained in the subroutine "state."

This code is based on the driver code 'guderley' first developed
by J. Bolstad of LLNL.

2007.08.01  S. Ramsey     Code reproduces correct results for gamma = 1.4

Code translated from Fortran to Python by J. Thrussell, 2022.09.23.
